        <h2>Thread Safety Levels Explained</h2>
        <p>
            Many classes in the TFS SDK for Java document their thread-safey level.  This document describes the
            different degrees of thread-safety.  Consider classes which do not document thread-safety to be <tt>thread-compatible</tt>. 
        </p>
        
        <h3>Class Thread-Safety</h3>
        <p>
            The thread-safety level advertised for a non-abstract class is the degree of safety
            users can expect from that class.  Abstract classes may document the safety of their implementation,
            but subclasses may declare a safer or less safe level of safety.  
        </p>
        <p>
            If a class does not specify a required level of thread-safety, assume <tt>thread-compatible</tt>. 
        </p>

        <h3>Interface Thread-Safety</h3>
        <p>
            A thread-safety requirement for an interface is different than for a class.  The level specified for an interface
            is the <em>minimum level</em> of thread-safety required for all implementations of that interface.  
            Interfaces will rarely require <tt>immutable</tt>, 
            <tt>conditionally thread-safe</tt>, or <tt>thread-hostile</tt> implementations because of the
            design constraints they would impose.  Interfaces will occasionally require <tt>thread-safe</tt> 
            or <tt>thread-compatible</tt> implementations. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If an interface does not specify a required level of thread-safety, assume <tt>thread-compatible</tt>. 
        </p>
        
        <h3>Levels Defined</h3>
        <p>
            Below are the levels of thread-safety the TFS SDK for Java documentation declares.  The safest
            levels (most concurrency-friendly) are described first, and the least safe (least concurrency-friendly)
            are last.  Find more detailed information about these degrees of safety in the article

            <dt>Immutable</dt>
            <dd>
                <tt>Immutable</tt> objects are always thread-safe and require no external synchronization.
            </dd>
            
            <dt>Thread-safe</dt>
            <dd>
                <tt>Thread-safe</tt> objects operate according to their specifications when accessed by multiple 
                threads without requiring external synchronization 
            </dd>
            
            <dt>Conditionally thread-safe</dt>
            <dd>
                <tt>Conditionally thread-safe</tt> objects have operations which are individually thread-safe, but may
                require external synchronization if they are used together in certain sequences.  An example is 
                the iterator object returned by some Java collections: if the collection is modified during
                iteration, the iterator may throw an exception.  The caller is required to prevent
                modification to the object (external synchronization) while the iterator is in use.    
            </dd>
            
            <dt>Thread-compatible</dt>
            <dd>
                <tt>Thread-compatible</tt> objects are not thread-safe but can be made safe for use by multiple threads if 
                external synchronization is used.  Most classes are at least this thread-safe, even if they 
                perform no internal synchronization.
            </dd>
            
            <dt>Thread-hostile</dt>
            <dd>
                <tt>Thread-hostile</tt> objects can't be made safe for concurrent use, even if external 
                synchronization is used.  These kinds of objects are rare, and include classes that modify static
                data in a way that affects other threads.  An example is a class that calls System.setOut(), which 
                uses native code to reassign a static final field, System.out.
