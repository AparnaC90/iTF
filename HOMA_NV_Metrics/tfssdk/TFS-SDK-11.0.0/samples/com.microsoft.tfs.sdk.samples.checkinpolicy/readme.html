<title>Sample Check-in Policy Plug-in for Eclipse</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p><em>com.microsoft.tfs.sdk.samples.checkinpolicy</em> is an
Eclipse Java project that demonstrates the basics of check-in policy
development for the TFS Plug-in for Eclipse. It
should be imported into an Eclipse instance where Team Explorer
Everywhere is installed.</p>
<p>The sample project source code in this project demonstrates the
following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Policy type declaration, integration via extension point</li>
	<li>Graphical configuration of the policy via SWT</li>
	<li>Persistence of policy settings</li>
	<li>Policy evaluation (where failures are generated)</li>
	<li>Cancellation and progress reporting during evaluation</li>
	<li>Help and "failure activation" to provide detailed information
	to the user</li>
</ul>

<h1>Sample Walkthrough</h1>

<p>This section will help you configure Eclipse, import, build,
debug, and deploy the sample plug-in project. Developing your own custom
check-in policy plug-in follows similar steps. If you have developed
Eclipse plug-ins before and are familiar with the general process, you
can import the sample project and include it a debug/run configuration
with the Team Explorer Everywhere plug-ins to test it. First-time
plug-in developers are encouraged to follow the steps below.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note:</p>
<p>Your Eclipse installation must include Eclipse plug-in
development features to work with this sample. The Eclipse products that
can develop plug-ins are known as <em>Eclipse for RCP/Plug-in
Developers</em>. Plug-in development capabilities of other Eclipse-based IDEs
including Rational and Adobe products vary.</p>
<p>If your IDE does not support plug-in development features, you
can use a supported version of the basic Eclipse IDE to develop your
check-in policy, then deploy to a different IDE. Plug-in development
features are not required for deployment.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>1. Configure Eclipse</h3>
<p>Ensure your configured Target Platform includes the correct
version of the TFS Plug-in for Eclipse. You can
configure your Target Platform in the <em>Plug-in Development &gt;
Target Platform</em> area of the Eclipse preferences. Make sure all of the <em>com.microsoft.tfs.*</em>
plug-ins and its dependencies are checked</p>

<h3>2. Import the Sample Project</h3>
<p>Use Eclipse's <em>File &gt; Import...</em> menu item to import
this sample project into your Eclipse workspace.</p>

<h3>3. Build</h3>
<p>The sample project may build automatically after it is imported,
depending on your Eclipse settings. If the sample project does not build
without errors, check Eclipse's <em>Problems</em> view. Also, make sure
your target platform includes the Team Explorer Everywhere plug-ins.</p>

<h3>4. Test</h3>
<h4>Create a debug configuration that includes the sample plug-in</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Create a new <em>Eclipse Application</em> debug configuration
	(<em>Run &gt; Debug Configurations...</em>).</li>
	<li>With your new configuration selected, select the <em>Plug-ins</em>
	tab of the configuration dialog and make sure the <em>com.microsoft.tfs.sdk.samples.checkinpolicy</em>
	plug-in is listed and checked. In newer versions of Eclipse you may
	have to change the <em>Launch with</em> option to <em>with
	selected plug-ins only</em> in order to see the sample plug-in.</li>
	<li>Click <em>Debug</em> to launch another Eclipse instance.</li>
	<li>When Eclipse starts, verify the sample check-in policy is
	available: choose <em>Help &gt; Team Explorer Support...</em>, select
	the <em>Diagnostic Data</em> tab, then select the <em>Team
	Explorer &gt; Available Check-in Policies</em> area.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Configure a team project to use the sample check-in policy
(requires AdminProjectRights to the team project)</h4>
<ol>
	<li>In the Eclipse instance that is being debugged, open the Team
	Explorer view (<em>Window &gt; Show View &gt; Other... &gt; Team
	Foundation Server &gt; Team Explorer</em>).</li>
	<li>In the Team Explorer view, click on Settings page and
	choose <em>Check-in Policies</em></li>
	<li>In the <em>Check-in Policies</em> dialog, click <em>Add...</em>,
	select the sample policy, then click OK. Configure the policy if the
	configuration dialog appears and click OK.</li>
	<li>Click OK to close the check-in policies dialog, saving the
	configuration to the team project.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Trigger policy evaluation</h4>
<p>In the Eclipse instance that is being debugged, open the Pending
Changes page (<em>Window &gt; Show View &gt; Other... &gt; Team
Foundation Server, click on Pending Changes page</em>). Create some pending changes
by checking out one or more files. Expand <em>Actions</em> dropdown list and choose <em>Evaluate Check-in Policies</em>.</p>
<p>Rhe Policy Warnings section on the top of the Pending
Changes page shows the current warnings ("failures" returned by
policies). If a pending change contains the substring you configured the
sample policy to reject, you should see an item in the warnings list.</p>
<p>You can set breakpoints in the sample code and trigger them while
the debugged Eclipse runs by manually evaluating policies. Exit the
debugged Eclipse when you are finished testing.</p>

<h3>5. Deploy to Eclipse</h3>
<p>Since check-in policies for the TFS Plug-in for
Eclipse are simply Eclipse plug-ins, they can be deployed to a target
IDE using any method it supports. Refer to Eclipse documentation on
building and deploying plug-ins for more information.</p>
<p>A simple method of deployment is to export the plug-in project to
a <em>deployable plug-in</em>, the output of which can be copied into
the <em>dropins</em> directory (or <em>plugins</em> directory for older
Eclipse versions) of the target IDE.</p>
<ol>
	<li>In <em>Package Explorer</em>, right-click on the sample
	plug-in project and choose <em>Export...</em>.</li>
	<li>In the dialog that appears, select <em>Plug-in
	Development &gt; Deployable plug-ins and fragments</em> as the destination
	and click <em>Next</em>.</li>
	<li>Choose your preferred output format and name, then complete
	the wizard.</li>
</ol>
<p>The process for installing your exported plug-in into a target
IDE is specific to the target IDE, but most support a <em>dropins</em>
directory. If you exported to a directory, copy all the plug-ins that
were written to the <em>plugins</em> subdirectory of the output
directory to the <em>dropins</em> directory in the target IDE, then
restart the target IDE. If the target IDE does not have a <em>dropins</em>
directory, copy the files to the <em>plugins</em> directory instead. See
the target IDE's documentation on installing additional plug-ins for
more information.</p>

<h1>Creating a New Policy Plug-in</h1>
<p>Creating a check-in policy plug-in from scratch is easy. You can
use the plug-in development wizards provided with Eclispe to get
started, and you can always reference the sample policy project and
source code for the basics. Instructions in this section may refer to
features and labels specific to Eclipse 3.6, but similar functionality
is available in all version of Eclipse 3.2 and newer. We'll create a
policy that checks "code quality" in this example. Simply change the
names for your policy.</p>

<h2>Create a New Project</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Make sure Team Explorer Everywhere is installed and its
	plug-ins are included in your target platform (see the Sample
	Walkthrough section for instructions on configuring the target
	platform).</li>
	<li>Create a new plug-in project. Click <em>File &gt; New
	&gt; Other...</em>. In the dialog that appears choose <em>Plug-in
	Project</em> and click <em>Next</em>.</li>
	<li>On the <em>Plug-in Project</em> wizard page:
	<ul>
		<li>Give your project a name. A Java name with package like <em>com.mycompany.policies.codequality</em>
		is recommended.</li>
		<li>Choose the correct Target Platform for your application (the
		default is usually OK).</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Click <em>Next</em>, then fill in the plug-in properties:
	<ul>
		<li>Activator generation and UI contributions are optional for
		all policy plug-ins.</li>
		<li>Select <em>No</em> for <em>Would you like to create a
		rich client application?</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Click <em>Finish</em> to complete the wizard.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Define Dependencies</h2>
<p>Open the new project's <em>plugin.xml</em> file if it did not
open automatically. Choose the <em class="UILabel">Dependencies</em> tab
in the plug-in editor.</p>


<h2>Extension Points</h2>
<p>The check-in policy framework loads policy implementations (like
the sample) through the <em>com.microsoft.tfs.checkinpolicies.checkinPolicy</em>
extension point. All check-in policy plug-ins must contribute an
extension at this point, and this is done in the <em>plugin.xml</em>
file in the plug-in's project. You can view the sample project's <em>plugin.xml</em>
source code to see how it contributes to this extension point by
declaring a policy type ID and a class that implements the ID.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note: For details on check-in policy types, including suggestions
for choosing a policy type ID, see the Javadoc on the <em>com.microsoft.tfs.core.checkinpolicies.PolicyType</em>
class.</p>
