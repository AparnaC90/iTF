<title>Custom Work Item Controls for Plug-in for Eclipse</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p><em>com.microsoft.tfs.sdk.samples.witcontrols</em> is an Eclipse
Java project that demonstrates the basics of TFS work item tracking
custom control development for the TFS Plug-in for
Eclipse. It should be imported into an Eclipse instance where Team
Explorer Everywhere is installed. you can avoid the need to create a Java based custom work item control by setting the editor to be the embedded one which will use a web based custom work item control. However, if you want to enable custom work item controls for the SWT based editor then this sample shows you how. 
</p>
<p>Source code for for the following custom controls is included:</p>
<ul>
	<li>SimpleButtonControl: demonstrates the most basic control which
	implements IWorkItemControl</li>
	<li>RadioButtonsControl: radio button control which stores its
	value in a work item field</li>
	<li>ExternalSourceDropdown: (Abstract) autocomplete combo box
	which gets its list of allowed/suggested values from an external
	source.</li>
	<li>FileSourceDropdown: Implementation of ExternalSourceDropdown
	which reads its list of values from a file</li>
</ul>

<h1>Sample Walkthrough</h1>

<p>This section will help you configure Eclipse, import, build,
debug, and deploy the sample plug-in project. Developing your own custom
work item control plug-in follows similar steps. If you have developed
Eclipse plug-ins before and are familiar with the general process, you
can import the sample project and include it a debug/run configuration
with the Team Explorer Everywhere plug-ins to test it. First-time
plug-in developers are encouraged to follow the steps below.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note:</p>
<p>Your Eclipse installation must include Eclipse plug-in
development features to work with this sample. The Eclipse products that
can develop plug-ins are known as <em>Eclipse for RCP/Plug-in
Developers</em>. Plug-in development capabilities of other Eclipse-based IDEs
including Rational and Adobe products vary.</p>
<p>If your IDE does not support plug-in development features, you
can use a supported version of the basic Eclipse IDE to develop your
check-in policy, then deploy to a different IDE. Plug-in development
features are not required for deployment.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>1. Configure Eclipse</h3>
<p>Ensure your configured Target Platform includes the correct
version of the TFS Plug-in for Eclipse. You can
configure your Target Platform in the <em>Plug-in Development &gt;
Target Platform</em> area of the Eclipse preferences. Make sure all of the <em>com.microsoft.tfs.*</em>
plug-ins and its dependencies are checked</p>

<h3>2. Import the Sample Project</h3>
<p>Use Eclipse's <em>File &gt; Import...</em> menu item to import
this sample project into your Eclipse workspace.</p>

<h3>3. Build</h3>
<p>The sample project may build automatically after it is imported,
depending on your Eclipse settings. If the sample project does not build
without errors, check Eclipse's <em>Problems</em> view. Also, make sure
your target platform includes the Team Explorer Everywhere plug-ins.</p>

<h3>4. Test</h3>

<h4>Prepare the work item type definition for uploading</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Open the <em>TEECustomControlsBug.xml</em> in this sample
	project in a text editor. This file is a work item type definition file
	for a <em>TEECustomControlsBug</em> work item, which is a standard MSF
	Agile <em>Bug</em> with modifications that demonstrate the controls
	included in this sample.</li>
	<li>Find the occurrences of the string <em>C:\temp\choices.txt</em>
	in this file. The FileSourceDropdown sample control reads choices from
	this file on each client where it is deployed. You can change this path
	to something else you prefer. For deployment to non-Windows clients,
	the sample control code will need to be modified to use a different
	path convention or some other configuration.</li>
	<li>Save any changes you made to <em>TEECustomControlsBug.xml</em>
	and close it.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Upload a work item type definition to TFS that uses the custom
controls</h4>
<p>Uploading the new type definition requires running the <em>witadmin.exe</em>
program on a Windows computer where the Visual Studio 2012 client
software is installed (see <em>\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft
Visual Studio 2012\Common7\IDE\witadmin.exe</em>). For TFS 2005 and 2008, use
the <em>witimport.exe</em> program instead.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Run <em>witadmin.exe</em>, supplying your TFS server,
	collection, team project, and path as necessary:
	<blockquote>
	<pre>witadmin.exe importwitd /collection:http://server:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection /p:TeamProjectName /f:Path\To\TEECustomControlsBug.xml</pre>
	</blockquote>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>The definition needs to be sent to the server ("imported") each
time it changes. Refer to TFS documentation on work item customization
for details.</p>

<h4>Create a debug configuration that includes the sample plug-in</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Create a new <em>Eclipse Application</em> debug configuration
	(<em>Run &gt; Debug Configurations...</em>).</li>
	<li>With your new configuration selected, select the <em>Plug-ins</em>
	tab of the configuration dialog and make sure the <em>com.microsoft.tfs.sdk.samples.witcontrols</em>
	plug-in is listed and checked. In newer versions of Eclipse you may
	have to change the <em>Launch with</em> option to <em>with
	selected plug-ins only</em> in order to see the sample plug-in.</li>
	<li>Click <em>Debug</em> to launch another Eclipse instance.</li>
</ol>

<h4>View and use the custom work item controls</h4>
<p>In the Eclipse instance that is being debugged, open the Team
Explorer view (<em>Window &gt; Show View &gt; Other... &gt; Team
Foundation Server &gt; Team Explorer</em>). Click on the <em>Work
Items</em> page in the team project you uploaded the work item type
definition to and choose <em>New Work Item &gt; TEECustomControlsBug</em>. A new
work item appears that contains the custom controls in this sample.</p>
<p>You can set breakpoints in the sample code and trigger them while
the debugged Eclipse runs by manipulating the work item form. Exit the
debugged Eclipse when you are finished testing.</p>

<h3>5. Deploy to Eclipse</h3>
<p>Since custom work item controls for Team Explorer Everywhere
Plug-in for Eclipse are simply Eclipse plug-ins, they can be deployed to
a target IDE using any method it supports. Refer to Eclipse
documentation on building and deploying plug-ins for more information.</p>
<p>A simple method of deployment is to export the plug-in project to
a <em>deployable plug-in</em>, the output of which can be copied into
the <em>dropins</em> directory (or <em>plugins</em> directory for older
Eclipse versions) of the target IDE.</p>
<ol>
	<li>In <em>Package Explorer</em>, right-click on the sample
	plug-in project and choose <em>Export...</em>.</li>
	<li>In the dialog that appears, select <em>Plug-in
	Development &gt; Deployable plug-ins and fragments</em> as the destination
	and click <em>Next</em>.</li>
	<li>Choose your preferred output format and name, then complete
	the wizard.</li>
</ol>
<p>The process for installing your exported plug-in into a target
IDE is specific to the target IDE, but most support a <em>dropins</em>
directory. If you exported to a directory, copy all the plug-ins that
were written to the <em>plugins</em> subdirectory of the output
directory to the <em>dropins</em> directory in the target IDE, then
restart the target IDE. If the target IDE does not have a <em>dropins</em>
directory, copy the files to the <em>plugins</em> directory instead. See
the target IDE's documentation on installing additional plug-ins for
more information.</p>
